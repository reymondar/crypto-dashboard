## Introduction

This project was created by me. If you want to contribute you can write <a href="mailto:aranaramon1@gmail.com?subject=Crypto%20app">here </a>. 

I was intreseted in learning more about working with API's, using react-query and Next.js.

I created this project on Next.js (typescript). I started by installing a popular library called Chartjs and react-chartjs-2 to create the graphs. Then react-query to manage api responses and Sass for the styling.

I learned so much so much. More than with any other project or course I created because I optimized every aspect on the fly. Of course there is still some refactor to make, like the responsiveness and typescript errors but other than that I used a ton of react tools to make this app flyy.

## Design

So I took this design from behance, and it should look something like this:


I limited myself to just creating the dashboard since every back-end dev I know is busy or simply not answering my texts. I'd like to use this project to learn back-end in the future but for now I'm more than happy with the result.

## Next challenges

Okay, so for now This is a hell of a ride. For my next project I'm adding Gatsby.js, Tailwind CSS and many more stuff to my knowledge box a.k.a the brain.
